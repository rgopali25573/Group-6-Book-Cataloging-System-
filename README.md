## ðŸ“š Book Cataloging System (Ruby + GTK3) Implementation

There are a total of five files for the ruby implementation. Where,
- **book.rb** Defines what a book is, its attributes, and how it can be converted to/from JSON-friendly format.
- **book_manager.rb** loading and saving data from **books.json** and adding, removing, and searching attributes.
- **cli.rb** is the CLI(Command Line Interface) of the program where the user can choose from the options.
- **gui.rb** is the implementation of graphical interface using The **GTK3** GUI App.
- **books.json** is the data storage file for the books.

A GUI-based Book Cataloging System built with **Ruby** and **GTK3**, designed to help users manage a collection of books with features to add, remove, update, and search books by various attributes. The system also supports persistent storage and includes a visually enhanced interface.
